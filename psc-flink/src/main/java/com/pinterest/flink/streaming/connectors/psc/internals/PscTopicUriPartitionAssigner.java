     * Returns the index of the target subtask that a specific PSC topic URI partition should be
     * assigned to.

     * <p>The resulting distribution of partitions of a single topic has the following contract:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>1. Uniformly distributed across subtasks</li>
     *     <li>2. Partitions are round-robin distributed (strictly clockwise w.r.t. ascending
     *     subtask indices) by using the partition id as the offset from a starting index
     *     (i.e., the index of the subtask which partition 0 of the topic will be assigned to,
     *     determined using the topic name).</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The above contract is crucial and cannot be broken. Consumer subtasks rely on this
     * contract to locally filter out partitions that it should not subscribe to, guaranteeing
     * that all partitions of a single topic will always be assigned to some subtask in a
     * uniformly distributed manner.
